# Shift Webmonitor ( Web Version / [Server Version](https://https://github.com/PNWDrew/shift-monitor.git) )
Tool to watch your servers status. Height, Consensus and Forging status. Next turn and last forged block time.

## Requisites

* You can install this script on your server or **upload it to any web hosting including Phantom**;
* Make sure you **whitelist all your IPs** in API and Forging sections of Shift *config.json* in all servers;

## Installation
Download all files to your computer.

Then you need to edit **config.json** file with all your proper data. You can use it for Mainnet and Testnet both or only for Mainnet.

> "m_name" **// Mainnet delagate username;**

> "t_name" **// Testnet delagate username;**

> "m_publicKey" **// Mainnet publicKey;**

>  "name" **// Your server's name;**

>  "http" **// Your server's connection;**
